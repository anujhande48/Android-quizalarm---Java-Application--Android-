Alarm System like any other Alarm System on Android Device allows the user to
set an Alarm. While Setting an Alarm the user to select or enter the Time in the 24 hour
Clock format, can name the Alarm and can set an Alarm tone. While Selecting the Alarm
tone, the tone is play backed.
This system has no option for snooze, but has a unique Activity to shut the Alarm Off.
The Activity is a Simple Quiz of GK or Mathematical Questions. Once the User has selected
the right answer the Alarm will be shut off. The Alarm can be updated or the Old Alarm can
be turned on from the Home Page. This System uses a Background Service to check the
current time and the time in the database.
